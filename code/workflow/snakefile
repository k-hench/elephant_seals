      Ahoi there,
      we are using `{params.wd}` as working directory,
      while `{params.base_dir}` is the base directory
      of this project.

      There are several sub-tasks witihin this pipeline,
      that can be invoked as follows:

      - run `snakemake <options> -R cleanup_all` to remove intermediate files that can not be flagged with temp() due to modularized pipeline setup
      - run `snakemake <options> -R ncbi_download` for the download of the refernce geonmes
      - run `snakemake <options> -R all_repeat` for the optional repeat masking of the refernce geonmes
      - run `snakemake <options> -R align_all` for the alignment of the elephan seal genomes to the california sea lion genome
      - run `snakemake <options> -R cactus_prep` to set up the jobs for the cactus alignment of the carnivora genomes
      - run `snakemake <options> -R cactus_stepwise` to run the cactus alignment in a step-wise fashion
      
      Overall project parameters can be edited within `config.yml`.
